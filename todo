TODO: 
- [ ] currently debugging issue: 
        when testing this out, it doesnt work. when i clear the meals, make a new one (fruit salad) of a few fruit ingredients (apple, pear), then update the apple ingredients calories by 20, it doesnt reflect on the fruit salad meal.
  - [ ] so, console log the data coming in from db. maybe the localstorage is the issue -- i checked the log meal btn and the old data persists
- [ ] get data to render in and update smoothly.

AI Recommendation Mod:

I have a new AI mod id like to create. its called AI Food Recommendation, its purpose is used recommend the next meal for the user based on their craving, remaining macros needed and potentially their meal/ingredient database.

When the user opens the mod modal they can:
- check box the type of food theyre craving (salty/sweet/etc.), 
- decide if want it to be based around common staple ingredients data, all ingredients data or anything, 
- fill in an optional text box for their preferences
then submit a request to my ai api where it can produce 3 meal recommendations. if the user likes a specifc meal, they can add it to their "todays meal" list. Each list can have a name, macros, a visual showing where they'd be if they chose that meal, and a description of the meal. Design a way to cleanly demo the options.

When submitting, the request to the ai api, it should include the type of food theyre craving, the time of day (to consider if there will be other meals later, so it doesnt have to produce a meal that checks all boxes), the users current macros, their goals, if the staples or ingredients are selected then send those sets of data along with the meals data (so my ai api "can" select from the list of meal if it deems, but shouldnt be forced. the most important thing is the ingredience), and send whatever else is relavent to ensure the ai can produce the best result for the user.


Edge cases:
If no ingredients or meals, disable the ability for the user to require a response centered around those values.

Constraints:
The meals shouldnt be designed to fill up the rest of the remaining macros the user needs unless its around dinner time. if its morning or mid-day, the meal should be reasonable.




AI Ingredient Lookup:

when the user opens up the ingredients modals, next to the barcode lookup, i want an AI Lookup option, which then prompts the user to describe an ingredient, which is asked to gemini api, and the response values are populated into the form fields name, calories, unit and macros. Giving the user the chance to read them over and submit adding the new ingredient. 

I also want this to be flexible enough to descibe for a serving size or for a whole portion of said item. But by default it'd  be a serving size.

A use case for this would be where the user wants to add a serving of a bell pepper, instead of looking it up, the user can stay within the app and have ai search it and input the values, allowing the user to simply verify the values and naming.
